## Workflows

We have set up the following GitHub workflows to streamline development:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: This workflow runs on every pull request and checks the code for errors, style issues, and test failures to ensure code quality.

- **Automatic Deployment**: Once changes are merged into the `main` branch, this workflow automatically deploys the application to our production server.

Both workflows are configured to ensure a smooth development and deployment process.

Please feel free to check the `/.github/workflows` directory for more details on the workflows.
